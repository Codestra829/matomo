/**
 * Interface for a job processor.
 *
 * Job processors pull URLs from some location and execute them, either sequentially
 * or with some level of concurrency.
 *
 * All job processors should try to support the same processor being used to process
 * the same list of jobs on multiple machines.
 *
 * Job processors allow callbacks to be executed before one or more jobs is started,
 * and after one or more jobs finishes. Individual callbacks associated with jobs
 * must be executed before & after individual jobs.
 *
 * Note that all jobs can throw exceptions. In such case the processor should not
 * fail, so callback executions must be surrounded by try-catches.
 *
 * Should normally be used with a class implementing {@link \Piwik\Jobs|Queue}.
 *
 * **NOTE: This API is not stable.**
